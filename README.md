# SMA Crossover Strategy Project Guideline

## Project Overview
This project implements and backtests a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover trading strategy using Python and the Backtrader library. The strategy is optimized using grid search to find the best parameters.

## Detailed Sections

### 1. Install the necessary libraries & Ignore warnings
- Import required modules (warnings, backtrader, yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tabulate)
- Configure warnings to be ignored
- Install necessary libraries using pip (if needed)

### 2. SMA crossover strategy class
- Define the `SMACrossStrategy` class, which inherits from `bt.Strategy`
- Implement strategy logic:
  - Set up parameters for short/long windows and trade size
  - Calculate short and long SMAs
  - Generate buy/sell signals based on SMA crossovers
  - Manage position sizing and trade execution
  - Track trades, equity, and drawdown
- Implement methods for:
  - Calculating trade size
  - Handling trade notifications

### 3. Define Backtest Engine class
- Create the `BacktestingEngine` class
- Implement methods for:
  - Downloading and processing historical data
  - Running backtests
  - Analyzing results (including performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, returns, volatility)
  - Plotting results
  - Optimizing strategy parameters
  - Displaying optimization results (including heatmaps and 3D surface plots)

### 4. Backtest the strategy (find the best parameters by GridSearch)
- Set up the main execution block
- Create an instance of the BacktestingEngine
- Define parameter ranges for optimization:
  - Short MA range
  - Long MA range
  - Trade size range
- Run the optimization process using grid search
- Display the best parameters and corresponding performance metrics
- Plot the results using the optimal parameters
- Visualize the optimization results using heatmaps and 3D surface plots

## Next Steps
- Test the strategy on different assets and timeframes
- Implement additional technical indicators or entry/exit conditions
- Explore more sophisticated optimization techniques (e.g., genetic algorithms)
- Incorporate advanced risk management features
- Consider real-world factors like slippage and more realistic commission structures
- Implement walk-forward optimization or out-of-sample testing

By following this guideline, you'll create a comprehensive SMA Crossover Strategy project that covers strategy development, backtesting, optimization, and analysis, aligned with the structure of your existing code.
